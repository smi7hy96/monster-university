# MONSTERS UNIVERSITY

In this application, the Monster University Admin can create students and courses and then enroll the students on a particular course. Once they begin to progress they will develop new skills which can also be added as an attribute to each student.

Developed using Test Driven Development and UnitTests, this application uses multiple classes and some inheritance (StudentMonster inherits from Monster)
